# codereps
*Final Project for CodeCore Cohort 12 Demo Day*

**Codereps is a web application that allows coders to practice coding using spaced repetition.** After signing up, users are presented with a set of interactive flashcards with coding challenges that fit their experience and language preference. When the queue resets, challenges are reordered by their perceived level of difficulty, ensuring that users spend more time studying code that challenges them. User input is tested with specs written in Jasmine. Users can also have access to stats, such as their current streak count and total reps completed.
